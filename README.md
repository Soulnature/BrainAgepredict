## Induction
this code is achieve the 3D hot network model for prediction brain ageï¼Œ include the SFCN[1], resnet[2], and other modified network(SE resnet). Which can using the Grey matter, 
White matter and CSF or raw image  as the input data.And we test the model on 2000+ sample , the age range from 8 to 90 years.
## Result
### Model
In the model  directory, we provide the pre-train model as follow 
- SFCN
- 3D ResNet
- Resnet
- 3D CNN
